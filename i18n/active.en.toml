The host receives a randomly selected word and provides hints about its meaning without using words with the same root. Then, all players attempt to guess the word. The game concludes when a participant correctly identifies the word.\n\nYou can invite me to a group chat to play with friends, or engage in a solo competition against the AI in single-player mode. The game is available in multiple languages and with varying levels of difficulty."
